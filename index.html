		<h1>Hi. I'm Alisha Ukani.</h1>

					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>I'm a rising junior at Weston High School, and I love computer science. I took AP Computer Science as a freshman, and have been learning web development during the past year. I recently made two TwitterBots, <a>PoliticsBot</a> and <a>AustenBot</a> that use Markov chains to generate text. I also made hublr, a Chrome extension that adds content discovery features to GitHub, and a <a>GPA calculator</a> that is being used in my school.</a></p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
					<p>I am taking this course because I enjoy web development, but I have never made a web app that communicates with a database to provide dynamic content. I am excited to learn how to do this!</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h2>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
					<p>As I mentioned in the Introduction, I have had a lot of experience making websites that are used in my school. I am very comfortable with creating basic websites using HTML and CSS (and Javascript).</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
					<p>I took AP Computer Science as a freshman and got a 5 on the exam. This was my first real exposure to programming. Since then, I have explored web development. I am comfortable with the languages: JavaScript, Coffeescript, Python, Java, Ruby, and Scheme. I also have experience using jQuery and Ruby on Rails.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h2>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>
					<p>I have learned a little bit of PHP with Codecademy, but I have never created a project with it.</p> 
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h2>Describe your level of experience with programming.</h2>
					<p>As said before, I know the basics of web development, and did well in my AP Computer Science course. Through various projects, I have become very experienced with programming in general.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
					<p>I am working on a Mac, and I use iTerm and Sublime Text 2.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="col-md-4">
					<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
					<p>I am really excited to be in this course! I will be teaching a basic web development course at my school during the next school year, which will cover HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope that I will be able to use this class to show students how they can apply their skills after completing the introductory course!</p>
