					<h2>Introduction<br class="visible-lg"></br></h2>
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus hidden"></span>
					<p>I am a rising junior at Weston High School and a Harvard Summer school student. I am passionate about molecular biology and computer science, especially web development. I took AP Computer Science as a freshman (and got a 5!), and since then, I have written Twitter Bots (which won an award at the CodeDay Boston Hackathon), a Chrome extension, and some websites that are used around my school.</p>

				<div class="question col-md-4 green">
					<h2>Why are you taking this course?</h2>
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus hidden"></span>
					<p>I am taking this course because I enjoy web development, but I have never made a web app that communicates with a database to provide dynamic content. I am excited to learn how to do this!</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question col-md-4 blue">
					<h2>What previous experience do you have with HTML/CSS?</h2>
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus hidden"></span>
					<p>As I mentioned in the Introduction, I have had a lot of experience making websites that are used in my school. I am very comfortable with creating basic websites using HTML and CSS (and Javascript).</p>

				<div class="question col-md-4 green">
					<h2>What previous experience do you have with programming?</h2>
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus hidden"></span>
					<p>I took AP Computer Science as a freshman and got a 5 on the exam. This was my first real exposure to programming. Since then, I have explored web development. I am comfortable with the languages: JavaScript, Coffeescript, Python, Java, Ruby, and Scheme. I also have experience using jQuery and Ruby on Rails.</p>

				<div class="question col-md-4 blue">
					<h2>Have you worked with PHP before? If so, to what extent?</h2>
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus hidden"></span>
					<p>I have completed the PHP course on Codecademy, but I have never created a project with it.</p> 
				</div>

				<div class="question col-md-4 green">
					<h2>Describe your level of experience with programming.</h2>
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus hidden"></span>
					<p>As said before, I know the basics of web development, and did well in my AP Computer Science course. Through various projects, I have become very experienced with programming in general.</p>

				<div class="question col-md-4 blue">
					<h2>Are you working on a Mac, PC, or some other platform?</h2>
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus hidden"></span>
					<p>I am working on a Mac, and I use iTerm and Sublime Text 2.</p>
				</div>

				<div class="question col-md-4 green">
					<h2>Anything else we should know?</h2>
					<span class="glyphicon glyphicon-plus"></span><span class="glyphicon glyphicon-minus hidden"></span>
					<p>I am really excited to be in this course! I will be teaching a basic web development course at my school during the next school year, which will cover HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. I hope that I will be able to use this class to show students how they can apply their skills after completing the introductory course!</p>
