					<h2>Introduction</h2>
					<p>I'm a rising junior at Weston High School, and I love computer science. I took AP Computer Science as a freshman, and have been learning web development during the past year. I recently made two TwitterBots, <a>PoliticsBot</a> and <a>AustenBot</a> that use Markov chains to generate text. I also made hublr, a Chrome extension that adds content discovery features to GitHub, and a <a>GPA calculator</a> that is being used in my school.</a></p>
